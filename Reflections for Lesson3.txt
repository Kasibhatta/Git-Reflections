I will be adding reflections for Lesson 3 here
So far I have understood how GitHub works for creating new repositories from my desk.  It is a wonderful concept

Why would we always want to manually pull changes rather than automatically?
When you do pulls like this, you might accidentally override changes in your own version with what you pull.
