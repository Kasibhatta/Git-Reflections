How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It helped me by bringing the old version and new version next to each other, so that I can
compare everything in a quick fashion.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would help me to quickly recollect what was done when and also let me go back to a previously known working version
if I have some problems with the current version.  I can then quickly identify exactly where the problem could be and fix
it soon.
